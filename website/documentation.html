<h3>Installing and building the software</h3>

    <p>At the top if this and every page are links to download
        the source code for this project. The package will
        unpack itself into a folder. In that folder, you will find
        a file called INSTALL. Follow the simple instructions
        in that file to build EthSlurp.

<h3>Usage:</h3>

<pre><code><h3>
 ethslurp [-i|-e|-d|-f|-l|-m|-s|-p:fmt|-t|-o|-b|-c|-v|-h] addr

 Fetches data off the Ethereum block chain for an
 arbitrary account or smart contract. Optionally
 formats the output to your specification.

 Where:
   addr	the address of the account or contract to slurp
   -i	include income transactions only
   -e	include expenditures transaction only
   -d	specify a start date or date range
   -l	re-display the last slurp without providing address<!--   -m	export only the most interesting data fields -->
   -s	force a slurp from the blockchain (ignore cache)
   -p	pretty print the output
          optionally ':txt', ':csv', otherwise ':json'<!--   -t	report only totals -->
   -o	open the results in its associated editor
   -b	save a date stamped backup of the previous slurp
   -c	clear all cached slurps
   -v	debug level: -v0 no debug output, -v3 most
   -h	display this help screen
</code></pre>

<h3>Running the software the first time</h3>
    <p>The first time you run EthSlurp, it will ask you for an
        API key from <a href=http://etherscan.io/apis>http://etherscan.io/apis</a>
        website. We do this because if we used our own API key for all
        installed versions of this software, the number of requests
        to ehterscan.io would exceed the limit of api calls per
        second. If each user supplies their own API key, this
        problem is alliviated.

<h3>Cached data</h3>
    <p>EthSlurp pulls data from the block chain under three conditions:
        (1) the first time you slurp an address, (2) on subsequent
        slurps of the same address if the previous slurp is older than
        five minutes, and (3) if you supply the '-s' flag. At all other
        times, EthSlurp pulls its data from a locally stored cache.
        This is necessary to minimize the number of times the program
        hits the etherscan.io apis. You may change the refresh rate
        in a <a href=config.html>configuration file</a>.

<h3>Planned improvements</h3>
    <p>The primary improvement we hope to provide before entering
        beta testing will be to pull the data directly from the
        Ethereum block chain as opposed to hitting up etherscan.io
        apis. This will greatly improve the speed of the software
        and remove the five minute caching requirement. Additionally,
        you will no longer need an etherscan.io API key.
