<h3>Installing and Building the Software:</h3>
<p>At the top if this and every page are links to download the source code for the software to
your local machine. When you unpack that file, you will see a file called INSTALL. Follow the
simple instructions in that file to build and install ethslurp.

<h3>Command line:</h3>

<pre><code><h3>ethslurp

Usage:   ethslurp [-b|-p|-s|-v|-h] addr

Fetches data off the Ethereum block chain for an 
arbitrary account or smart contract. Optionally 
prettyPrints or stores the data in various formats.

Where:

addr	the address of the account or contract to slurp
 -b	save a date stamped backup of the previous slurp
 -p	pretty print the output json file
 -s	pull fresh data from the blockchain
 -v	debug level: -v0 no debug output, -v3 most
 -h	display this help screen
</code></pre>

<h3>Running the software the first time:</h3>
<p>The first time you run ethslurp, it will ask you for an API key from http://etherscan.io/apis website.
We do this because if we used our own API key for all installed versions of this software, the
number of requests to ehterscan.io would exceed the limit of api calls per second. If each user
supplies their own API key, this problem is alliviated.

<h3>Cached data:</h3>
<p>Ethslurp pulls data from the block chain under two conditions. (1) if you supply the
'-p' flag, and (2) if the last time you pulled data for the given slurp is older than
five minutes. At all other times, ethslurp pulls the data from a local cache. We do this
to minimize the number of times we hit the etherscan.io apis.

<h3>Planned Improvements:</h3>
We are working on reading directly from the Ethereum block chain databases. When that feature
is completed we can eliminte the need to call into etherscan.io's web api. This will greatly
improve the speed of the software and also remove the five minute caching requirement. Additionally
you will no longer need an etherscan.io API key.
