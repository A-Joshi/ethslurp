<h3>Introduction</h3>

    <p>Many of ethslurp's options are available through
        the command line interface (cli). Other features,
        which do not fit easily into the cli, are accessible
        through a configuration file which is documented
        here. The file is called ethslurp.conf and is stored
        in ethslurp's cache folder.

<h3>EthSlurp's cache folder and the config file</h3>

    <p>Each time the program slurps block chain data, it stores that
        data in a binary format in a folder under the end user's
        $HOME folder called ~/.ethslurp. We store the configuration
        file (ethslurp.conf) in this same folder.

    <p>Configuration items are stored in the ethslurp.conf file on a
        single line (or, if more than one line, the line ends with
        the continuation mark ('\'). Additionally, configuration
        items are stored under an appropriate group header. The
        group header stands on its own line and is surrounded by
        square brackets:

<pre><code> #--------------------------------------------------------------
 # Contents of ethslurp.conf (lines starting with # are comments)
 #--------------------------------------------------------------
 [GROUP_HEADER_1]
 config_item1=A value stored on a single line
 config_item2=A series of values stored on multiple lines \
    any continued line of which ends with a backslash.

 [GROUP_HEADER_2]
 other_item=Another item
</code></pre>

        <p>Individual configuration items are detailed below.

<h3>Configuration items</h3>
        <p><h6 style="display:inline">[SETTINGS] api_key</h6>:
            This value is required in the current version of
            ethslurp because we use the etherscan.io apis. Each
            user must have thier own individual api key. We need
            to do this this because if every user used our api
            key, we would go over the per second limit on api
            calls pretty quickly. The software will not work
            until you provide your own key. In the future, we
            will read the block chain data directly from the
            block chain databases which will obviate the need
            for this parameter.

        <p><h6 style="display:inline">[SETTINGS] reset_rate</h6>:
            By default ethslurp will only pull data from the
            block chain once every five minutes. This pararameter
            allows you to change the frequancy of update. The value
            is in seconds (therefore it defaults to 300). The
            lower limit on this value is 60 seconds (see above).

        <p><h6 style="display:inline">[EXPORT] fmt</h6>:
            By default the results of the slurp are not formatted.
            In the special case of the -p (pretty print) command
            line option the results of the slurp are presented in
            a pretty print manner making them easier to read. You
            may, however, wish to have the data presented in numerous
            ways including tab seperated text files and/or comma
            seperated values that can be opened in MS Excel. This
            parameter allows you to control the format of the
            exported data. It is further detailed <a href="export.html">here</a>.

        <p><h6 style="display:inline">[SETTINGS] api_key</h6>: This value
        is required in the current version of the software because
        we use the etherscan.io apis. Each user of the software must
        have thier own individual api key. We did this because
        if every user was using our api key, we would go over
        the per second limit on api calls. The software will note
        work unless you get your own key. In the future, we will
        try to read directly from the block chain data which will
        obviate the need for this parameter.

        The format of this fileEach configuration item is stored on a single line in this file
        (or the line ends with a continuation mark '\'). theadThe transactions that Ethslurp reads from the block chain
        are written back to your hard drive in a format that makes
        using the data easier. This data is stored in a cache file
        in the user's home folder called ~/.ethslurp/slurps. Also
        in the ~/.ethslurp file you will find a configuration file
        called ~/.ethslurp/ethslurp.conf. In this file we store
        various bits of useful information. You may open this file
        with any text editor. The file's format is very obvious, therefore
        we document only the options available below:

<h3>Cached data</h3>
    <p>Ethslurp pulls data from the block chain under three conditions:
        (1) the first time you slurp an address, (2) once every five
        minutes, and (3) if you supply the '-s' flag. At all other
        times, ethslurp pulls the data from a locally stored cache.
        This is necessary to minimize the number of times the program
        hits the etherscan.io apis. You may change the refresh rate
        in a <a href=config.html>configuration file</a>.

<h3>Planned improvements</h3>
    <p>The primary improvement we hope to provide before entering
        beta testing will be to pull the data directly from the
        Ethereum block chain as opposed to hitting up etherscan.io
        apis. This will greatly improve the speed of the software
        and remove the five minute caching requirement. Additionally,
        you will no longer need an etherscan.io API key.
