<h3>Welcome to EthSlurp</h3>

    <p>EthSlurp allows you to 'slurp' the Ethereum blockchain extracting
        transactions from any Ethereum address, including smart contracts.
        For example,

    <pre><big> ethslurp 0xbb9bc244d798123fde783fcc1c72d3bb8c189413</big></pre>

    <p>returns every external transaction, both in to and out of, "The DAO."
        However, if you run the above command (don't it takes a long time),
        you will get JSON formatted data--that is, computer gobbeldy-gook.

    <p>This is where EthSlurp shines. Using the pretty print (-p) option
        you can make the output human readable.

        <pre><big> ethslurp -p 0xbb9bc244d798123fde783fcc1c72d3bb8c189413</big></pre>

    <p>It's even better than that. The output format is fully customizable using
        a feature called <a href=export.html>display strings</a>. You
        can choose which fields to export, which fields to ignore,
        what format the export takes.

    <p>For example, by changing a single configuration line, you can create
        a .csv file that can be opened in MS Excel, or an HTML web page.
        There are many other options detailed in the <a href=documentation.html>documentation</a>.<p>

<h3>What can I do with EthSlurp</h3>

    <p>Let's say you've deployed a smart contract. How do you account for it?
        With EthSlurp you can create the information you need to
        fully account for all the ins and outs of your contact. You
        can even filter the transactions by date. Wouldn't it be nice
        to finally know if your contracts are making any money?

    <!-- p>We use a version of this software as the back-end of our website
        <a href=http://daoreporter.com>DAO Reporter</a>. Of course, there are
        many other uses for the software. If you think of a novel use,
        please join us on our slack and let us know. -->

<h3>Building the software</h3>

    <p>We do not provide binaries (mostly because we don't know how). You must
        download the source code and compile it yourself. Don't worry--it's easy.
        Information on how to build the software is provided on the
        <a href=documentation.html>documentation</a> page.

    <p>We also don't know how to make a full-fledged package, and there are a few
        dependencies which may not resolve. Please join our git account and
        help us out. Email use with questions:
        <a href="mailto:info@ethslurp.com">info@ethslurp.com</a></p>

<h3>Cautions and warnings</h3>

    <p>This software is pre-beta. We are working on making it as robust as
        possible, but it's in an early phase. Please use it at your own risk.
        The software is provided as is, and is hereby released into the public
        domain.</p>
