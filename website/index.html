<h3>Welcome to EthSlurp.</h3>

    <p>Given the address of any Ethereum account or smart contract 'ethslurp' returns a list
        of all transactions either to or from that account. For example,

    <pre>ethslurp 0xbb9bc244d798123fde783fcc1c72d3bb8c189413</pre>

    <p>returns all transactions to and from "The DAO." Try it out.<p>You will notice that the
        format of the returned data is difficult to read. Use the -p option to pretty print the output.
        Try this:

    <pre>ethslurp -p 0xbb9bc244d798123fde783fcc1c72d3bb8c189413</pre>

    There are many other options detailed in the <a href=documentation.html>documentation</a>.<p>

<h3>What Can I Use It For</h3>

    <p>Let's say you're a gambler and want to participate in an Ethereum
        gambling website. The website claims to pay out 99% of incoming
        revenue. Use 'ethslurp' with the -ti (total income) and the -te
        (total expended) options to check up on them.

    <p>Another use might be to keep track of your own smart contract. You can get
        a report on all the gas spent by your contract, all its income, and any
        expenditures. Wouldn't it be nice to know if the contract was making money?

    <p>The best use we've found for 'ethslurp' is to run in the background of our
        website in order to prepare block chain data customized to our needs. We
        run the <a href=daoreporter.com>DAO Reporter</a> website where we present
        personalized tracking of your ether's interactions with various contracts
        and other accounts. Pay us a visit.

<h3>Building the software</h3>

    <p>We do not provide binaries (mostly because we don't know how). You have to download the source
        code and compile it. Don't worry--it's easy. Information on building is provided on the 
        <a href=documentation.html>documentation</a> page.

    <p>We also don't know how to make a full-fledged package and there are a few
        dependencies which may not resolve. Please email use with questions:
        <a href="mailto:ethslurp@greathill.com">ethslurp@greathill.com</a></p>

<h3>Cautions and Warnings</h3>

    <p>This software is pre-beta. We are working on making it as robust as possible. Please
        use at your own risk. This software is provided as is and released into the public
        domain by Great Hill Corporation.</p>
