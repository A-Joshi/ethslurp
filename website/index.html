<h3>Welcome to EthSlurp</h3>

    <p>'slurp' the Ethereum blockchain extracting incoming and/or
        outgoing transactions from a given address. With our flexible templating
        language, you can format the output however you wish.
        For example,

    <pre><big> ethslurp 0xbb9bc244d798123fde783fcc1c72d3bb8c189413</big></pre>

    <p>returns all transactions both into and out of the "The DAO." If you
        run the above command, you will notice that output is very
        difficult to read. Use the -p option to pretty print the
        output.

        <pre><big> ethslurp -p 0xbb9bc244d798123fde783fcc1c72d3bb8c189413</big></pre>

    There are many other options detailed in the <a href=documentation.html>documentation</a>.<p>

<h3>What can I do with EthSlurp</h3>

    <!-- p>Let's say you're an Ethereum gambler, and you want to bet on a
        gambling website. The website provides an address, the source code,
        and claims to pay out 99%. Like most people, you don't read source. Use
        'ethslurp' to check that the code actually does what it says it does. -->

    <p>Let's say you run a smart contract. How do you account for it?
        With 'ethslurp' you can create the information you need for
        a profit and loss statement. You can even provide a time span.
        Furhtermore, you can use the price feed (-f) option to generate
        your report in any fiat currency you want. Wouldn't it be nice
        to know if your contracts are making any money?

    <p>We use a version of this software as the back-end of our website
        <a href=http://daoreporter.com>DAO Reporter</a>. Of course, there are
        many other uses for the software. If you think of a novel use,
        please join us on our slack and let us know.

<h3>Building the software</h3>

    <p>We do not provide binaries (mostly because we don't know how). You must
        download the source code and compile it yourself. Don't worry--it's easy.
        Information on how to build the software is provided on the
        <a href=documentation.html>documentation</a> page.

    <p>We also don't know how to make a full-fledged package, and there are a few
        dependencies which may not resolve. Please join our git account and
        help us out. Email use with questions:
        <a href="mailto:info@ethslurp.com">info@ethslurp.com</a></p>

<h3>Cautions and warnings</h3>

    <p>This software is pre-beta. We are working on making it as robust as
        possible, but it's in an early phase. Please use it at your own risk.
        The software is provided as is, and is hereby released into the public
        domain.</p>
