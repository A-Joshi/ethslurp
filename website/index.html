<span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to EthSlurp.</h3>

<p>Ethslurp allows you to generate pretty-printed JSON 'slurps' of the blockchain, 
reporting on transactions either 'sent' or 'received' or 'both' from particular Ethereum 
addresses. For example, you may show all interactions with a particular smart contract or 
DAO. Prove to yourself that the gambling site you're betting on is being as honest as they 
claim to be. Using other command line programs you can easily sum up and analyze incoming 
and outgoing ether into an address.</p>

<a id="how-it-works" class="anchor" href="#how-it-works" aria-hidden="true">
<span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How it Works</h3>

<p>The software currently works by using the etherscan.io web API. In future versions, 
we hope to read directly from the block chain databases stored on a running node. If 
you know how to do this, and you wish to help us out, please join. Because we use 
etherscan.io's web interface, and there are limits on that interface, you must register 
for an API key yourself. The first time you run our software, it will ask you for that 
API key. Note: if we didn't do this and all installation of Ethslurp use our API key, 
it would quickly exceed the etherscan.io API five requests per second limit.</p>

<span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Building the software</h3>

<p>We do not provide binaries. What you will be downloading is the source code, which should 
compile on most systems. We don't know how to make a full-fledged package and there are a few 
dependencies which may not resolve. Please email use with questions:

<p>This software is pre-beta. We are working on making it as robust as possible. Please use 
at your own risk. This software is provided as is and released into the public domain by 
Great Hill Corporation.</p>
