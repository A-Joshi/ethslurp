Thanks for downloading EthSlurp.

Follow these instructions to compile and use our software.

    1. Open a command prompt or terminal window on your system.

    2. Change to the folder containing this file.

    3. From the command prompt enter 'make clean' then 'make'.

It should be as simple as that.

#------------------
# Running EthSlurp
#------------------
To run the software navigate to the same folder as above and enter:

    ./ethslurp version

If the version string appears, the software is ready to go.

At any time you may enter -h to see the program's help
screen. If you wish, you may copy or move the executable
to any folder in your $PATH.

Good luck.
