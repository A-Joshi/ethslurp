Thanks for downloading the source code for building EthSlurp.

Please follow these instructions to compile and use the software.
These instructions assume you already have a C++ compiler and a make
system installed on your computer:

1. Download this software and unzip it into a temporary folder.

2. Open a command prompt or terminal window on your system.

3. Find the unzipped folder and, from there, find the ./src
    subfolder. Change into the ./src folder.

4. From the command line type the command 'make' and press enter.

Building the software should be as simple as that. From here all
you need to do is copy or move the executable (it's called ethslurp
and it's in this folder) to a folder in your $PATH.

Run ./ethslurp and a help screen should appear. If it does, you're
ready to start slurping.

Bon chance
