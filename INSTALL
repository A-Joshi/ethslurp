Thanks for downloading EthSlurp.

Follow these instructions to compile and use the software.
These instructions assume you already have a C++ compiler and a make
system installed on your computer:

    1. Open a command prompt or terminal window on your system.

    2. Change to the folder containing this file.

    3. From the command prompt type 'make' and press enter.

It should be as simple as that.

#------------------
# Running EthSlurp
#------------------
In the folder you built the software in type:

    ./ethslurp

The help screen should appear. If it does, you're ready to
start slurping the Ethereum block chain. If you wish,
you may copy or move the executable to any folder
in your $PATH.

Bon chance
